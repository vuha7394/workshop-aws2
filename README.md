# PyTorch Fundamentals Practice

Welcome to the PyTorch Fundamentals practice notebook! This notebook is designed to help you strengthen your understanding of the basic concepts of PyTorch, a powerful open-source machine learning library for Python.

## Requirements

Before starting the exercises, ensure you are comfortable with the following:

- **Basic Python programming**: Familiarity with Python syntax and data structures.
- **Basic understanding of Tensors**: A fundamental concept in PyTorch.
- **Familiarity with NumPy**: Although not mandatory, knowing NumPy can be helpful since PyTorch is similar to NumPy in many ways.
- **Basic concepts of machine learning**: Not required but beneficial for understanding PyTorch concepts more easily.

## Instructions

1. **Read Each Exercise**: Each exercise consists of a question and a corresponding code cell for your answer.
2. **Write Your Solution**: Implement your solution in the provided code cell.
3. **Run Evaluation Code**: After writing your solution, run the evaluation code to check your answer. The evaluation code cell is provided after each exercise.
4. **Do Not Modify Evaluation Code**: Avoid modifying the evaluation code as it may lead to incorrect results.

Happy coding, and good luck with your PyTorch practice!
